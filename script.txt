In animation, we finished implementing basic animation, and building custom 
file format. So, we are in the middle of integrating this with the editor, 
and once it's done, these resources will be managed by our library system.
Currently, we set up two major goals for the graphics.
One is automatic loading resources into the editor. This will make artists 
can modify their assets fast and convenient. 
The other goal is procedural animation. Through this method, we are 
expecting to harmonize our models' movement with the physics. It will 
improve our models' animation much more realistic without setting tons of 
keyframes for every single movement.
